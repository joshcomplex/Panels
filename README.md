# Setting Up Your Python Virtual Environment

This guide will help you set up a Python virtual environment for your project.

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

## Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

### For macOS/Linux:
To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### For Windows:
To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install Required Packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Clone the Project Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshcomplex/reflex-panels
```

## Step 5: Initialize Reflex

Finally, initialize Reflex with the following command:

```bash
reflex init
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to activate the virtual environment each time you start a new terminal session for this project.
- To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```
